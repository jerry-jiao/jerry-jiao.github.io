    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="paragraph-wrapper">
      <p>I'm a Chinese Canadian born in Beijing, China and grew up in Vancouver, Canada. Currently a sophomore at the
        University of California, Berkeley, I'm majoring in EECS and hope to pursue a minor in Data Science as well. I am also interested in
        business, and would love to start my own company one day. In the meantime, I am mainly looking for opportunities in the tech industry and
        I enjoy building projects of all kinds (this website included!) - I especially take satisfaction in the process of bringing my ideas to
        fruition while making new discoveries and learning new things. To unwind from the stress and intensity of college, I enjoy playing board
        games with friends, following my hometown Vancouver Canucks in the NHL, and learning how to cook. Below you can see more of what I do outside
        of school, but if you'd like to get down to business feel free to continue to the 'Projects' tab!
